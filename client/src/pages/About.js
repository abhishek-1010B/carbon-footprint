      <h1>Take Your First Carbon Footsteps With Us!</h1>
      <p>
        We here at Carbon Footsteps believe that it is important for all of us
        to reduce our contributions to climate change. This team of full-stack
        developers was inspired to answer the question: Where do we start to
        lower our CO2 emissions? After searching for a carbon footprint
        calculator, we decided to research and make our own! Each piece of the
        calculator, each graph, each pledge was crafted by the team below. We
        know it can be tough and guilt-inducing to learn about your carbon
        footprint. We are here to help you take the baby steps to offset your
        emissions and feel proud to fulfill your goals! Contact any member of
        the team below to get your questions answered, and click on our GitHub
        repositories to see more of our work.
